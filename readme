This is the branch where I expect to keep my annotations on this
project. The idea is to keep branch master untouched so I can benefit
from new commits of OmegaT developers.

The rest of this file contains the readme for the master branch

This is a fork of the excellent app OmegaT.

You can find the original at http://www.omegat.org/ and please do it
if you are interested in the working version.

This fork is here mainly for learning purposes. If for any unexpected
reason I produce something that can be of any use for you, please feel
free. Anything new here maintains the original OmegaT license:
